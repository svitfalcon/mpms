MULTI PATIENT MONITORING SYSTEM

Considering the present pandemic situation, we observe that the number of patients is only increasing day-by-day, whereas, the number of doctors and caretakers are limited. Monitoring a huge number of patients, by remembering or noting down their details, and then treating them is possible but one doctor or a caretaker can only monitor one or three patients at the max. Let's take an emergency situation. We all know that, during this pandemic situation, a patient's health cannot be determined. Therefore, each and every patient is to be monitored at the same time. A tiny human error or delay in checking on the patient can take a precious life. This situation can be avoided by implementing our idea, which is, “Multiple patient monitoring systems”. A system which can read all the parameters of patients and update the same in the database, dynamically. And also reflect the vital parameter and conditions of all the patients in Web user interface. This continuous monitoring system can also alert the doctors and caretakers in case of any emergency.
